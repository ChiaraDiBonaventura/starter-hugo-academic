Hello World! I am a PhD student in [Safe and Trusted AI](https://safeandtrustedai.org/) at King's College London and Imperial College London where I am part of a cohort researching how to make AI safe and trustworthy. Currently, I work on leveraging world knowledge for abusive language detection systems under the supervision of [Albert Meroño-Peñuela](https://www.albertmeronyo.org/) and [Barbara McGillivray](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/barbara-mcgillivray). Before moving to London, I graduated in the MSc in Data Science at Bocconi University under the supervision of [Dirk Hovy](https://dmi.unibocconi.eu/people/dirk-hovy). 
My research interests include NLP, biases in language models and Knowledge Graphs.
